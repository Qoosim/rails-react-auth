# README

This is the result of watching Jordan Hudgens video tutorial's on YouTube for React/Rails Auth. Feel free to use it as a base.

I chose PostgreSQL for the DB so if you want to use something else you'll need to update the DB settings.

The React front-end is located in the `/front-end` directory.

Steps below to get it up and running on your local machine below.

`bundle`

`cd front-end`

`npm i`

`rails db:create`

`rails db:migrate`

`rake start`
